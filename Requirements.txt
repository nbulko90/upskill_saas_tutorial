  Stripe will return with a card token.

  app for validation.  Rails app should validate the user fields. 
  Rails app will note whether plan 1 or plan 2.
* Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id)
  and card token to Srtipe server and Stripe iwll cerate a subscription
  and send back customer token.  Rails should save customer token
